In a browser, when u have a metamask or any toher wallet, it is stored as a window object. You can access it by typing window.ethereum or window.solana (for phantom wallet)

If running the code on hardhat, make sure to include the Local hardhat network in your metamask and import one of the hardhat node accounts using the private key
